  ## Description

  This application was built using React with data from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me). It is designed to make it easy to search for employees by name or email using the search bar. The data pulled from the api is put together in a table that includes a picture, name, DOB, email and phone number of each employee. 


 ## User Story

  As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

   ## Busines Context

  An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.
